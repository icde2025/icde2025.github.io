                <p class="justify-align-main">
                    Review Quality:  ICDE 2025 papers will be stringently reviewed with at least 3 reviews per paper. The review process will be coordinated by the meta reviewer resulting in one of the decisions to either revise, accept, or reject the submission. A meta review will be provided based on the discussions about the submission. Paper revisions will go through an additional review consideration before a final decision is made to accept or reject the paper.  
                </p>

                <p class="justify-align-main">
                    Revisions: Authors may be invited to submit a revised version of their paper if the reviewers believe that the paper can reasonably be improved within the allocated revision time frame. Authors will have about one month to prepare their revisions. The revision process is intended to be a constructive interaction between reviewers and authors. The intent is to have reviewers specify a number of revisions for authors to address before a final decision on the paper would be made.

                    We value Diversity and Inclusion in our community and profession. Both are important in our writing as well. Be mindful in your writing of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Also be vigilant and guard against unintentionally exclusionary examples. Reviewers will be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise. Going further, also consider actively raising the representation of URGs in your writing. Diversity of representation in writing is a simple but visible avenue to celebrate and ultimately help improve our community’s diversity.

                    During submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about Conflicts of Interest (COI) of the paper’s authors with program committee (PC) members.

Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.
